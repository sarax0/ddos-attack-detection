# DDoS Attack Prediction (Machine Learning)
This project investigates machine learning approaches for predicting Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.

## Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The initial phase involved a thorough exploration of the DDoS attack dataset. This step aimed to uncover underlying patterns, relationships between features, and potential issues impacting model performance.

## Preprocessing: 
The data underwent a rigorous cleaning process to address missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. Categorical features were encoded for compatibility with machine learning algorithms. Feature selection techniques were then employed to identify the most relevant features for accurate prediction.

> Note: To ensure model generalizability, the impact of data scaling (normalization) on model performance was evaluated. Models were trained and tested on both scaled and unscaled data.

## Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models were implemented and compared for DDoS attack classification:

**Baseline Model:** 
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) served as the baseline model. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearch to optimize its performance.

**Advanced Models:**

Random Forest Classifier: This robust ensemble method was implemented to leverage the power of multiple decision trees for improved attack detection.

XGBoost Classifier: This powerful gradient boosting algorithm was employed to handle complex non-linear relationships within the data and enhance prediction accuracy.

## Model Evaluation and Selection
The performance of each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics for classification problems (beyond just accuracy). A comparative analysis was conducted to select the model with the most robust and generalizable performance for DDoS attack prediction.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in identifying patterns indicative of DDoS attacks. By employing a combination of data analysis, preprocessing techniques, and various classification algorithms, this project provides valuable insights for developing robust and scalable DDoS attack prediction systems.
